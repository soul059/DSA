## C++ Implementations

This section contains implementations of data structures and algorithms in C++. Each implementation is well-documented and includes example usage.

### Setting Up VS Code for DSA

To set up Visual Studio Code for working on data structures and algorithms in C++, follow these steps:

1. **Install VS Code**: Download and install Visual Studio Code from [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/).
2. **Install C++ Extension**: Go to the Extensions view by clicking on the Extensions icon in the Activity Bar on the side of the window. Search for "C++" and install the C/C++ extension by Microsoft.
3. **Set Up Compiler**: Ensure you have a C++ compiler installed. You can use MinGW for Windows, or GCC for Linux and macOS. Follow the instructions [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/cpp/config-mingw) to set up MinGW on Windows.
4. **Configure Build Tasks**: Create a `tasks.json` file in the `.vscode` folder to define build tasks. This helps in compiling and running your C++ code directly from VS Code.

### Notes


- **Arrays**: Arrays are a collection of elements stored at contiguous memory locations.
- **Linked Lists**: A linked list is a linear data structure where each element is a separate object.
- **Stacks**: A stack is a linear data structure that follows the LIFO (Last In First Out) principle.
- **Queues**: A queue is a linear data structure that follows the FIFO (First In First Out) principle.
- **Trees**: Trees are hierarchical data structures with a root node and child nodes forming a parent-child relationship.
- **Graphs**: Graphs are collections of nodes connected by edges.
- **Hash Tables**: Hash tables store key-value pairs and use a hash function to compute an index into an array of buckets.
- **Heaps**: Heaps are specialized tree-based data structures that satisfy the heap property.
